This is needed mostly for installing the function. You usually don't need to
supply this if you set `install` to false.

If not specified, caller's package will be used by default.

By default, generated function will be installed to the specified (or caller's)
package, as well as its generated metadata into %SPEC. Set this argument to
false to skip installing.
